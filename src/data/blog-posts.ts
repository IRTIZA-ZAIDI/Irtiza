Three years of building machine learning systems taught me that the real challenges aren't in the algorithms—they're in everything else. Here's what I wish I'd known when I started.

## The 80/20 Rule Still Applies

In most ML projects, 80% of your time won't be spent tweaking models. You'll be:

- **Data wrangling**: Cleaning, transforming, and understanding your data
- **Infrastructure**: Building pipelines, monitoring, and deployment systems  
- **Product integration**: Making your model work within existing systems
- **Debugging**: Finding out why your model works in notebooks but fails in production

## Start with Simple Baselines

Before building complex neural networks, establish simple baselines:

1. **Linear models**: Logistic regression, linear regression
2. **Tree-based models**: Random forests, gradient boosting
3. **Business rules**: Sometimes a few if-statements outperform ML

These baselines serve two purposes: they give you a performance target and help you understand your data better.

## Data Quality Trumps Model Complexity

I've seen teams spend months optimizing model architectures while ignoring data quality issues. Some common problems:

- **Label noise**: Inconsistent or incorrect labels
- **Data drift**: Training data that doesn't match production data
- **Feature leakage**: Using future information to predict the past

Fix your data pipeline before optimizing your model.

## Monitor Everything

Production ML systems fail in ways you can't anticipate. Monitor:

- **Model performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall over time
- **Data quality**: Distribution shifts, missing values, outliers
- **System health**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Business metrics**: How model predictions affect key business outcomes

## The Importance of Iteration Speed

Fast iteration cycles matter more than perfect models. Prioritize:

- Quick model training and evaluation
- Easy model deployment and rollback
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Automated testing and validation

## Technical Debt is Real

ML systems accumulate technical debt quickly. Common sources:

- **Glue code**: Scripts that connect different parts of your pipeline
- **Configuration debt**: Complex parameter files that become unmaintainable
- **Data dependencies**: Fragile connections between data sources
- **Model staleness**: Models that degrade over time without updates

Plan for refactoring from day one.

## Conclusion

Building production ML systems is as much about software engineering as it is about machine learning. Focus on building robust, maintainable systems that can evolve with your data and business needs.

The most successful ML projects I've seen prioritize simplicity, monitoring, and iteration speed over complex algorithms. Start there, and add complexity only when you need it.`,

    content: `# AI and the Future of Knowledge Work

As AI systems become more capable, we need to rethink how we approach knowledge work. This isn't about replacement—it's about augmentation and human-AI collaboration.

## The Current State of AI in Knowledge Work

Large language models like GPT-4 have shown remarkable capabilities in:

- Writing and editing
- Code generation and debugging
- Research and analysis
- Creative ideation

But they also have significant limitations:

- Hallucination and factual errors
- Lack of real-world grounding
- Difficulty with complex reasoning
- No understanding of context or consequences

## Augmentation, Not Replacement

The most effective applications of AI in knowledge work focus on augmentation:

### AI as a Research Assistant
- Quickly synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Generating initial drafts for human review
- Suggesting alternative approaches to problems

### AI as a Coding Partner
- Writing boilerplate code
- Explaining complex codebases
- Suggesting optimizations and bug fixes

### AI as a Creative Catalyst
- Brainstorming ideas
- Exploring different perspectives
- Overcoming creative blocks

## New Skills for the AI Era

Knowledge workers need to develop new skills:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Learning to communicate effectively with AI systems
2. **AI Literacy**: Understanding capabilities and limitations of AI tools
3. **Critical Evaluation**: Knowing when to trust AI output and when to verify
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Designing workflows that leverage both human and AI strengths

## The Importance of Human Judgment

While AI can process information quickly, humans provide:

- **Context and nuance**: Understanding the broader implications of decisions
- **Ethical reasoning**: Considering the moral dimensions of choices
- **Creativity and innovation**: Generating truly novel solutions
- **Emotional intelligence**: Understanding human needs and motivations

## Looking Forward

The future of knowledge work will likely involve:

- **Hybrid workflows**: Seamless integration of human and AI capabilities
- **Specialized AI tools**: Domain-specific models trained for particular industries
- **Better interfaces**: More intuitive ways to interact with AI systems
- **New collaboration models**: Teams that include both humans and AI agents

## Preparing for Change

Organizations and individuals should:

1. **Experiment**: Try different AI tools and find what works
2. **Invest in training**: Help workers develop AI collaboration skills
3. **Rethink processes**: Design workflows that maximize human-AI synergy
4. **Stay adaptable**: Be ready to evolve as AI capabilities improve

The goal isn't to replace human intelligence with artificial intelligence—it's to create augmented intelligence that combines the best of both.`,

After years of iterating on data science projects, I've developed a workflow that balances exploration with rigor. Here's my step-by-step approach to tackling new data problems.

## Phase 1: Problem Definition (Day 1-2)

Before touching any data, spend time understanding the problem:

### Business Context
- What business problem are we solving?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What does success look like?
- What are the constraints (time, budget, resources)?

### Technical Requirements
- What data is available?
- What's the expected output format?
- Are there performance requirements?
- How will the solution be deployed?

### Success Metrics
- How will we measure model performance?
- What business metrics will we track?
- What's the baseline we need to beat?
