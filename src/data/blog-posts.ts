    title: "Do CNNs Truly Recognize Objects or Just Their Backgrounds?",
    excerpt: "CNNs might not be recognizing the object you think they are. My experiments with VGG16 revealed that background context plays a surprisingly large role in classification decisions.",
    content: `When I started working with convolutional neural networks for image classification, I approached them as experimental observers, aiming to understand what features they actually use to recognize objects. If the model saw a zebra, I expected it to focus on the stripes. For an eagle, I anticipated attention to the beak and wingspan.

A central question emerged: Do CNNs recognize the object itself or the background context in which it appears? This question has practical implications. If the model learns associations such as penguins with snow or tigers with jungle, what happens when these objects appear in unfamiliar environments? To investigate, I conducted a series of experiments using a pre-trained VGG16 model.

## Setting the Stage

I selected 20 diverse animal classes from ImageNet to provide sufficient variability. The objective was not to train the network from scratch but to explore how an already trained model processes visual information and whether background influences classification.

## Step 1: Filters and Feature Map Visualization

The first experiment involved visualizing filters and feature maps across multiple convolutional layers. Early layers captured low-level features such as edges, gradients, and textures. Deeper layers represented more abstract shapes, patterns, and object parts. These observations aligned with typical CNN behavior and set the stage for deeper analysis.

## Step 2: Similarity Search on Feature Representations

I performed cosine and hard similarity searches on features extracted from different layers to determine what the filters were emphasizing. Early layers exhibited strong similarity to traditional edge detectors like Sobel and Gabor. In contrast, deeper layers shifted toward task-specific, abstract patterns. This confirmed that feature complexity increases with depth.

## Step 3: Feature Clustering and Habitat Correlation

Next, high-dimensional features were projected into two dimensions using PCA and UMAP. Unexpectedly, animals from similar habitats clustered together even when they were from different species. For example, birds grouped together, insects formed distinct clusters, and water or land animals often appeared near each other. These clusters suggested that habitat context contributes to how the model organizes features in its internal representation.

## Step 4: Background Manipulation Experiment

To directly test the influence of background, I conducted an experiment where animals were removed from their original environments and placed into mismatched backgrounds, such as a zebra in a desert or a polar bear in a rainforest. The altered images were then evaluated by the same VGG16 model.

![Feature Maps](/assets/crop1.png)  
![Feature Maps](/assets/crop2.png)

The results were significant. Out of 400 manipulated images, more than 325 were misclassified. Saliency maps and Grad-CAM confirmed that the model focused on the object itself, yet changes in background consistently disrupted predictions.

## Observations and Insights

The experiments revealed that CNNs leverage any available visual cues to optimize classification accuracy. Consistent background-object correlations can lead the network to rely on environmental context more than object-specific features. While this strategy can improve performance on controlled datasets, it introduces vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios with variable or unexpected backgrounds.

## Recommendations for Reducing Background Bias

To mitigate background dependency, I suggest:

- Training with segmented objects so the network cannot use background cues  
- Incorporating diverse and unrelated backgrounds for each class during training  
- Evaluating models with out-of-context images to identify hidden biases before deployment

## Conclusions

These experiments highlight several key insights. CNNs learn from both objects and their environments. Background correlations can introduce subtle but impactful biases. Developing reliable AI systems requires deliberate dataset design and robust evaluation practices.

In summary, when a CNN recognizes a cheetah, it may also be recognizing the savannah it occupies. Changing the savannah to a city street can drastically reduce the model’s confidence, demonstrating the importance of understanding context in AI systems.`,

  title: "Practical Techniques for LLM Fine-Tuning",
  excerpt: "Fine-tuning LLMs involves subtle technical choices that greatly affect cost, reliability, and developer time. Here are practical lessons from production experience.",
  content: `From my experience building and fine-tuning LLMs in production settings, the technical choices that look small on paper (how you format outputs, how you batch inference, whether you add a classifier head) are the ones that end up dominating cost, reliability, and developer time. This post collects those lessons into a single, pragmatic narrative: what works, why it works, and the tradeoffs to expect.

## Start with a clear input/output contract: chat vs completion formats

When designing a fine-tuning dataset, the first decision is the format of the examples. Broadly, there are two families: chat/completion format (a sequence of turns with roles) and single-turn completion formats (single prompt → output)

**Chat/completion style** is ideal for conversational products or when context across turns matters. It models role structure explicitly but adds engineering overhead

**Single-turn completion formats** are compact, easier to evaluate, and faster to fine-tune for atomic tasks like classification

**Example:**
Completion:
\`Input: "I loved the battery life but hate the screen glare."\`
\`Output: "Positive"\`

Chat:
\`System: You are a sentiment classifier.\`
\`User: Review: "I loved the battery life but hate the screen glare."\`
\`Assistant: Sentiment: Positive\`

**Pointers**
- Use chat format for multi-turn interactions, completion format for isolated classification tasks
- Consider hybrid pipelines: classify short inputs with completion examples, then wrap for chat UI
- Maintain small validation sets in both formats to test real-world behavior

## Batched decoding for inference: throughput vs latency

Batching multiple requests improves GPU utilization but may increase latency

Low batch sizes (5–10) often balance throughput and responsiveness on A100 GPUs  
Large batches are suitable for offline bulk scoring  
Consider speculative decoding for many short sequences

**Pointers**
- Benchmark batch sizes (1, 4, 8, 16) and choose based on SLA
- Offline jobs: maximize batch size for GPU efficiency
- Interactive workloads: use smaller batches and short queuing windows

## Structured outputs: reliability versus overhead

Structured outputs (JSON, CSV) reduce post-processing but increase inference complexity

Training the model to emit JSON is simple but error-prone  
Constrained decoding ensures correctness but adds latency  
Pragmatic approach: use tolerant structured outputs with post-validation for most tasks, strict constraints for mission-critical endpoints

**Pointers**
- Use post-validation for experiments
- Use constrained decoding when deterministic output is required
- Measure latency before adopting strict decoding

## Multi-instance outputs (the “many reviews” problem)

Models often skip, reorder, or merge items when generating multiple labels in one shot. Use ordered, natural-language anchors to reduce errors

**Pointers**
- Use repeated anchors like “X classification is: Y”
- Chunk long lists into groups of 5–10
- For single-shot structured mapping, add explicit separators and re-check outputs

## Classification by text generation vs classifier head

**Classifier head:** sample efficient, fast inference, best for stable label sets  
**Text-generation classification:** flexible, adapts to evolving labels, may require canonicalization layer

**Pointers**
- Stable, high-volume labels → classifier head
- Flexible or exploratory tasks → text-generation with canonicalization

## Prompt engineering: invest early and iterate

High-quality prompts reduce fine-tuning needs. Include task description, output format, and few-shot examples. Iterate using probe examples

**Pointers**
- Create baseline prompts with edge cases
- Run 20–50 probe examples
- Fine-tune on working prompt/format and validate on messy data

## End-to-end workflow

1. Problem framing → chat vs completion → validation set
2. Prompt/probe phase → iterate prompts
3. Fine-tune on stabilized prompt/format → re-validation
4. Benchmark batching and latency → select batch strategy
5. Deploy with thin validator → monitor for drift

## Common pitfalls

Optimizing offline metrics only → fails in production  
Over-engineering structure → increases latency/complexity  
Ignoring prompt + fine-tuning synergy → inefficient

**Pointers**
- Validate with production-like decoder and real-world examples
- Avoid mandatory structured outputs unless required
- Automate monitoring for skipped items or malformed outputs

## Closing: balance is the operational win

Fine-tuning LLMs is an engineering tradeoff across prompts, formats, inference, and post-processing. Focus on early prompt design and pragmatic engineering patterns for cost, reliability, and flexibility`,

Three years of building machine learning systems taught me that the real challenges aren't in the algorithms—they're in everything else. Here's what I wish I'd known when I started.

## The 80/20 Rule Still Applies

In most ML projects, 80% of your time won't be spent tweaking models. You'll be:

- **Data wrangling**: Cleaning, transforming, and understanding your data
- **Infrastructure**: Building pipelines, monitoring, and deployment systems  
- **Product integration**: Making your model work within existing systems
- **Debugging**: Finding out why your model works in notebooks but fails in production

## Start with Simple Baselines

Before building complex neural networks, establish simple baselines:

1. **Linear models**: Logistic regression, linear regression
2. **Tree-based models**: Random forests, gradient boosting
3. **Business rules**: Sometimes a few if-statements outperform ML

These baselines serve two purposes: they give you a performance target and help you understand your data better.

## Data Quality Trumps Model Complexity

I've seen teams spend months optimizing model architectures while ignoring data quality issues. Some common problems:

- **Label noise**: Inconsistent or incorrect labels
- **Data drift**: Training data that doesn't match production data
- **Feature leakage**: Using future information to predict the past

Fix your data pipeline before optimizing your model.

## Monitor Everything

Production ML systems fail in ways you can't anticipate. Monitor:

- **Model performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall over time
- **Data quality**: Distribution shifts, missing values, outliers
- **System health**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Business metrics**: How model predictions affect key business outcomes

## The Importance of Iteration Speed

Fast iteration cycles matter more than perfect models. Prioritize:

- Quick model training and evaluation
- Easy model deployment and rollback
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Automated testing and validation

## Technical Debt is Real

ML systems accumulate technical debt quickly. Common sources:

- **Glue code**: Scripts that connect different parts of your pipeline
- **Configuration debt**: Complex parameter files that become unmaintainable
- **Data dependencies**: Fragile connections between data sources
- **Model staleness**: Models that degrade over time without updates

Plan for refactoring from day one.

## Conclusion

Building production ML systems is as much about software engineering as it is about machine learning. Focus on building robust, maintainable systems that can evolve with your data and business needs.

The most successful ML projects I've seen prioritize simplicity, monitoring, and iteration speed over complex algorithms. Start there, and add complexity only when you need it.`,
